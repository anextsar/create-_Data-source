# create-_Data-source

Here's a breakdown of each line in the JSON configuration file for a SharePoint connection:

1. **`"name": "dhiraj-ds"`**  
   - This specifies the name of the SharePoint data source configuration, which is set to `"vaibhav-ds"`. This is an identifier for the data source and could help to organize or reference it in a larger application or project.

2. **`"type": "sharepoint"`**  
   - The type of data source being configured here is `sharepoint`, indicating this configuration connects specifically to SharePoint.

3. **`"credentials": {}`**  
   - This section contains the credentials required to authenticate and connect to the SharePoint site. These credentials include a `connectionString` with several important details.

4. **`"connectionString": "SharePointOnlineEndpoint=..."`**  
   - The connection string holds various parameters for authenticating to SharePoint Online. Each parameter within this string is separated by semicolons:
     - **`SharePointOnlineEndpoint`**: URL of the SharePoint Online site to connect to.
     - **`ApplicationId`**: The ID of the registered application in Azure AD that has permission to access the SharePoint site.
     - **`ApplicationSecret`**: A secret key or password for the application used to authenticate. 
     - **`TenantId`**: The Azure tenant ID for the SharePoint Online site, which uniquely identifies the organization's Azure Active Directory instance.

5. **`"container": {}`**  
   - This object specifies container-level details of the SharePoint data source.

6. **`"name": "useQuery"`**  
   - The container is named `useQuery`, which might be used to reference this container setup in queries or other parts of the application.

7. **`"query": "includeLibrary=...;additionalColumns=Department"`**  
   - The `query` parameter specifies the settings for the SharePoint data retrieval. 
     - **`includeLibrary`**: URL of the specific document library within SharePoint that the query will access. Here, it points to the **Shared Documents** section of the specified SharePoint site.
     - **`additionalColumns=Department`**: Specifies that the `Department` column will be included in the data fetched from SharePoint. This allows for the retrieval of custom metadata or categories associated with each document in the library.

Together, this configuration sets up a connection to a specific SharePoint document library and specifies additional document metadata that should be included in queries.
